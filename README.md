Premier Service Solutions is a company that provides maintenance on the equipment of its 
clients. Service contracts are entered into with clients, to maintain their equipment to 
contractually agreed service levels. Clients place calls to the Service Centre when they require 
maintenance work to be performed, where the details of the client’s problem are entered into 
the system. Jobs are created and assigned to technical staff members who will be responsible 
for executing them at the client’s location. The status of an incident is managed from the initial 
call, through scheduling for execution by technicians, performance of maintenance, until an 
incident is eventually closed when satisfactorily resolved. Full incident management through its 
lifecycle is required, along with escalation procedures. Management functions are required to 
enable viewing the state of all work in the system, taking executive action as appropriate, and 
measure the performance of employees in all departments. Client satisfaction is a primary 
priority for Premier Service Solutions, thus it is essential that the system be able to monitor, 
track and measure the performance of all actions. Exceptional situations must be identified 
and presented to appropriate users for action.
